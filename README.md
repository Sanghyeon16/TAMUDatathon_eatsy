# *eatsy*

*eatsy is a regression model that models what preferences are important to individual users and extrapolates this data to recommend a restaurant that satisfies the preferences for a group of users. It takes into account reviews on other online platforms and user-specific preferences and past experiences to find the perfect restaurant for everyone.* 

## Features
* Models with all the data in Yelp's open dataset that holds information on 200,000 businesses, over 6 million reviews, and 1.6 million users
* Implements machine learning techniques to predict the importance of certain preferences to a user
* Combines the importance of preferences of every user in a group optimally
* Uses a logistic regression model to calculate a score for each restaurant given a group of users
* Selects the top five restaurants that produce the highest scores for the group of users
